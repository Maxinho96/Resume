% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\section{Projects}

\descript{Video surveillance system (\href{https://github.com/Maxinho96/person\_identification}{Link})}
For the Master's thesis I developed a video surveillance system which can detect and segment people and  find their identities using a known dataset.

\descript{Object Detection with drone (\href{https://youtu.be/cnnGjHns818}{Link})}
For the Advanced School in Artificial Intelligence I developed an object detection system that works in real-time on a drone camera.

\descript{Telegram bot: Image Classifier (\href{https://github.com/Maxinho96/Image-Classifier-Telegram-Bot}{Link})}
As a personal project, I made a Telegram bot to which you can send an image to know what is the object in it.

\descript{Object recognition robot (\href{https://github.com/Maxinho96/Machine-Learning-Research-Project}{Link})}
For the Bachelor's thesis I developed a system meant to work on a robot that is able to recognize objects and autonomously learn unknown objects.
